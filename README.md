# pure-ui-react

A simple design system for React made with pure HTML tags and styled-components. This is still a work in progress, and far from complete, so a lot of stuff is missing and there may be some bugs, if you find any please let me know.

**Note: this package isn't related to any others like @pureui/core or similars**
